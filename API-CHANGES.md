# OpenAPI specification
---

The engineering team at Paymium has been quietly transitioning away from our old API documentation, and migrating to new docs that are based on an OpenAPI 2.0 schema. The new documentation is a significant improvement and provides benefits to both third party developers and Paymium engineering.

## Main changes
The main change is currency amounts format (see below for details). It were represented using the type Number in JSON. The accuracy for this data type returned by our servers was an arbitrary precision integer arithmetic (double). To conform with JSON standard and avoid that JSON clients parse these data as normal binary floating point arithmetic (float), we changed this representation into String type.

# What's New
---

## `POST` /user/withdrawals

> Create withdrawal

Withdrawals used:

    POST /user/orders with "Transfer" type

It's no longer necessary to specify type property with this new endpoint.

## `POST` /user/email_transfers

> Create email transfer

Email transfers used:

    POST /user/orders with "EmailTransfer" type
It's no longer necessary to specify type property with this new endpoint.


## `DELETE` /user/orders/{uuid}

> Cancel order

It replaces old endpoint:

    DELETE /user/orders/{uuid}/cancel

Old endpoint is marked as *DEPRECATED*, it didn't respond to REST resource naming in using CRUD function name in URI.
It still works in this API version.
